# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is Ajatuskumppani?

Ajatuskumppani (ThoughtMate OS in English) is an open-source, user-controlled AI platform built in Finland. It combines privacy, transparency, and intelligence through a decentralized infrastructure. Unlike traditional AI assistants, Ajatuskumppani learns from you continuously and grows alongside you, while you maintain complete control over your data.

### Why "Ajatuskumppani"?

"Ajatuskumppani" is Finnish for "thought companion" or "thought partner." The name reflects our vision of creating an AI that doesn't just respond to commands, but actively engages with your thoughts, learns your preferences, and becomes a true digital companion.

### Is Ajatuskumppani really free and open source?

Yes! All core components are open source under permissive licenses (Apache 2.0, AGPL 3.0, MIT). You can view, modify, and deploy the code yourself. The base version is completely free to use. Premium features are available for those who want additional capabilities.

### How is this different from ChatGPT or other AI assistants?

Key differences include:

- **Open Source**: All code and models are transparent and auditable
- **User Control**: You own your data and can run everything locally
- **Decentralized**: Powered by a distributed network, not a single company
- **Learning Memory**: Builds a persistent profile that evolves with you
- **Finnish-First**: Native support for Finnish language and culture
- **Token Economy**: Contributors are rewarded with AJT tokens

## Technical Questions

### What language model does Ajatuskumppani use?

We use **Mistral 7B Instruct** as our base model, fine-tuned with Finnish language data and user interactions. The model is Apache 2.0 licensed and can run on consumer hardware.

### Can I run Ajatuskumppani on my own computer?

Yes! You can run the entire stack locally using Docker Compose. For the LLM, you can use either vLLM (GPU) or Ollama (CPU). A machine with 16GB RAM and a modern CPU can run the basic version. For optimal performance, a GPU with 8GB+ VRAM is recommended.

### What are the system requirements?

**Minimum** (CPU-only):
- 16GB RAM
- 50GB storage
- Modern multi-core CPU

**Recommended** (with GPU):
- 32GB RAM
- 100GB storage
- NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM
- CUDA 11.8+

### How does the decentralized network work?

Users can run **AjatusNode** to contribute their computational resources to the network. The system uses a **Proof-of-Contribution (PoC)** algorithm to measure uptime, performance, and task completion. Contributors earn **AJT tokens** as rewards.

### Is my data private?

Yes. Your data is:
- **Encrypted at rest** and in transit
- **Stored locally** or in your chosen location
- **Never sold** or shared without your consent
- **GDPR compliant** with full data portability

You can export or delete your data at any time.

## Token Economy Questions

### What is the AJT token?

**AjatusToken (AJT)** is an ERC-20 utility token that powers the Ajatuskumppani ecosystem. It's used to reward contributors, unlock premium features, and participate in governance.

### How can I earn AJT tokens?

You can earn AJT by:
- Running an **AjatusNode** and contributing compute resources
- Contributing code, documentation, or translations
- Participating in community governance
- Completing bounties and challenges

### What can I do with AJT tokens?

- **Unlock Premium Features**: Access advanced AI capabilities
- **Stake for Rewards**: Earn additional tokens
- **Vote on Proposals**: Shape the future of the platform
- **Trade**: Exchange on supported platforms

### Is AJT an investment or security?

AJT is a **utility token**, not an investment or security. It's designed to facilitate the Ajatuskumppani ecosystem, not as a speculative asset. Always do your own research and consult with financial advisors.
