This document provides a comprehensive overview of the AjatusToken (AJT) economy, including its utility, distribution, and governance mechanisms.

## Token Overview

## Token Utility

AJT tokens have several key use cases within the Ajatuskumppani ecosystem:

### 1. Proof-of-Contribution Rewards

Users who contribute computational resources (CPU/GPU) or storage to the network through **AjatusNode** earn AJT tokens as rewards. The reward mechanism is based on a **Proof-of-Contribution (PoC)** algorithm that considers uptime, performance, and task validation.

**Reward Formula**:
```
Reward = Base_Rate × Performance_Score × Uptime_Factor × Task_Validation
```

Where:
- **Base_Rate**: The baseline reward per hour of contribution (e.g., 10 AJT/hour)
- **Performance_Score**: A score from 0 to 1 based on the node's computational performance
- **Uptime_Factor**: A multiplier based on the node's uptime percentage (e.g., 1.0 for 100% uptime)
- **Task_Validation**: A bonus multiplier for successfully completing and validating tasks

### 2. Premium Features

AJT tokens can be used to unlock premium features on the Ajatuskumppani platform:

- **Private AI Models**: Run your own fine-tuned models on dedicated infrastructure
- **Extended Context**: Access to larger context windows for more complex conversations
- **AR/VR Features**: Unlock augmented and virtual reality experiences
- **API Access**: Programmatic access to the Ajatuskumppani API
- **Priority Support**: Faster response times and dedicated support channels

**Pricing Example**:
- Private AI Model (monthly): 1,000 AJT
- Extended Context (monthly): 500 AJT
- AR/VR Features (monthly): 750 AJT
- API Access (monthly): 2,000 AJT

### 3. Governance

AJT holders can participate in the governance of the Ajatuskumppani ecosystem by voting on proposals. Each token represents one vote.

**Governance Areas**:
- Protocol upgrades and changes
- Treasury allocation and spending
- New feature prioritization
- Community grants and funding

### 4. Staking

Users can stake their AJT tokens to earn additional rewards and secure the network. Staking rewards are distributed from a portion of the transaction fees and newly minted tokens.

**Staking Rewards**:
- Annual Percentage Yield (APY): 5-15% (variable based on total staked amount)
- Minimum Stake: 100 AJT
- Lock-up Period: 30 days (optional, higher rewards for longer lock-ups)

## Token Distribution

The initial distribution of AJT tokens is designed to balance the needs of the team, early supporters, and the community.

| Category | Allocation | Amount | Vesting |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Community Rewards** | 40% | 400,000,000 AJT | Released over 5 years through PoC |
| **Team & Advisors** | 20% | 200,000,000 AJT | 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff |
| **Public Sale** | 15% | 150,000,000 AJT | No vesting |
| **Ecosystem Development** | 15% | 150,000,000 AJT | Released as needed for grants, partnerships |
| **Treasury** | 10% | 100,000,000 AJT | Controlled by governance |

## Token Release Schedule

The release of AJT tokens follows a carefully planned schedule to ensure long-term sustainability and prevent inflation.

**Year 1**: 150M AJT (15% of max supply)
- Public sale: 150M AJT
- Community rewards: 50M AJT

**Year 2**: 100M AJT (10% of max supply)
- Community rewards: 80M AJT
- Team vesting: 20M AJT

**Year 3**: 100M AJT (10% of max supply)
- Community rewards: 80M AJT
- Team vesting: 20M AJT

**Year 4**: 100M AJT (10% of max supply)
- Community rewards: 80M AJT
- Team vesting: 20M AJT

**Year 5+**: Remaining supply released gradually through community rewards and ecosystem development.

## Burn Mechanism

To prevent inflation and maintain token value, AJT implements a **burn mechanism**. A portion of tokens used for premium features and transaction fees are permanently removed from circulation.

**Burn Rate**:
- 10% of all premium feature payments are burned
- 5% of all transaction fees are burned
- Quarterly burn events based on platform usage

## Governance Model

The Ajatuskumppani governance model is designed to be transparent, inclusive, and effective.

### Proposal Process

1. **Proposal Submission**: Any AJT holder with at least 10,000 AJT can submit a proposal.
2. **Discussion Period**: 7 days for community discussion and feedback.
3. **Voting Period**: 7 days for token holders to vote (yes/no/abstain).
4. **Execution**: If the proposal passes (>50% yes votes with >10% quorum), it is executed after a 2-day timelock.

### Voting Power

- 1 AJT = 1 vote
- Staked tokens have 1.5x voting power
- Delegated voting is supported

## Security & Compliance

The AJT token contract has been designed with security and compliance in mind:

- **Audited Smart Contract**: The contract will be audited by a reputable third-party security firm before deployment.
- **GDPR Compliance**: User data and transaction history are handled in accordance with GDPR regulations.
- **KYC/AML**: For the public sale, KYC/AML procedures will be implemented to ensure compliance with regulations.
- **Upgradability**: The contract uses a proxy pattern to allow for future upgrades without disrupting the token economy.

## Future Developments

The AJT token economy will continue to evolve as the Ajatuskumppani ecosystem grows. Planned future developments include:

- **Cross-chain Bridge**: Enable AJT to be used on multiple blockchains.
- **Liquidity Mining**: Reward users for providing liquidity on decentralized exchanges.
- **NFT Integration**: Use AJT to purchase and trade NFT-based identities and assets.
- **DAO Treasury**: Transition to a fully decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for governance.
