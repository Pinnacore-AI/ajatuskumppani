## üìä Full Investment Proposal

### Executive Summary

**Ajatuskumppani** is building the first European decentralized AI operating system that combines:
- Advanced language models (Mistral 7B-based, Finnish-optimized)
- Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) on Solana
- User-controlled data and AI personalization
- Open-source transparency and GDPR compliance

We're seeking **strategic investment** to acquire NVIDIA DGX infrastructure and accelerate our path to mainnet launch.

### The Problem

1. **Centralized AI platforms** (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) control user data and models
2. **No European alternative** that prioritizes privacy and user ownership
3. **High compute costs** prevent democratization of AI
4. **Lack of transparency** in proprietary AI systems

### Our Solution

**Ajatuskumppani** solves these problems through:

1. **Open-Source AI Core**
   - Based on Mistral 7B (Apache 2.0 licensed)
   - Fine-tuned for Finnish language and culture
   - Community-auditable and transparent

2. **DePIN Architecture**
   - Distributed compute network on Solana
   - Node operators earn AJT tokens
   - Proof-of-Contribution rewards system
   - Lower costs through resource sharing

3. **User Ownership**
   - Users own their data and AI models
   - GDPR-compliant by design
   - Export and delete data anytime
   - No vendor lock-in

4. **DAO Governance**
   - Community-driven decision making
   - Token-based voting (1 AJT = 1 vote)
   - Transparent treasury management

### Market Opportunity

**Total Addressable Market:**
- Global AI market: **$200B+** (2024)
