# Ajatuskumppani in the Web3 Ecosystem

Ajatuskumppani is not just an AI platform—it's a **Web3-native decentralized AI operating system** that combines artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, token economics, and decentralized infrastructure.

## 🌐 Web3 Vision

Our vision is to create the first **truly decentralized AI platform** where:

- Users own their data and AI models
- Contributors are rewarded with tokens for their compute resources
- Governance is community-driven through DAO mechanisms
- Infrastructure is distributed across a global network of nodes

## 🔗 Blockchain Integration

### AJT Token (ERC-20)

The **AjatusToken (AJT)** is the native utility token of the Ajatuskumppani ecosystem.

**Token Details**:
- **Symbol**: AJT
- **Type**: ERC-20 Utility Token
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (with plans for L2 scaling)
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 AJT
- **Smart Contract**: [View on GitHub](https://github.com/Pinnacore-AI/ajatus-token)

**Token Utilities**:
1. **Compute Payments** - Pay for AI inference and training
2. **Staking Rewards** - Stake AJT to earn passive income
3. **Governance Voting** - Vote on protocol upgrades and proposals
4. **Premium Features** - Unlock advanced AI capabilities
5. **Node Licensing** - Required to run AjatusNode

### Token Distribution

| Allocation | Percentage | Tokens | Vesting |
|-----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Community Rewards** | 40% | 400,000,000 | 4 years |
| **Development Fund** | 25% | 250,000,000 | 3 years |
| **Ecosystem Growth** | 15% | 150,000,000 | 2 years |
| **Team & Advisors** | 10% | 100,000,000 | 4 years |
| **Public Sale** | 10% | 100,000,000 | No vesting |

## 🏗️ DePIN Architecture

Ajatuskumppani is built on a **Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN)** model.

### How DePIN Works

**AjatusNode** operators contribute physical compute resources (GPUs, CPUs, storage) to the network and earn AJT tokens based on:

1. **Uptime** - How long the node has been online
2. **Performance** - Quality and speed of inference
3. **Availability** - Response time and reliability
4. **Stake** - Amount of AJT staked to the node

### Proof-of-Contribution (PoC)

Unlike traditional Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake, Ajatuskumppani uses **Proof-of-Contribution**:

```
Reward = (Uptime × Performance × Availability × Stake) / Total_Network_Contribution
```

This ensures that nodes are rewarded fairly based on their actual contribution to the network.

## 🗳️ DAO Governance

Ajatuskumppani will transition to a **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** for community governance.

### Governance Powers

AJT token holders can vote on:

- Protocol upgrades and changes
- Treasury fund allocation
- New feature development priorities
- Partnership approvals
- Token economics adjustments

### Voting Mechanism

- **1 AJT = 1 Vote** (with quadratic voting for major decisions)
- **Proposal Threshold**: 10,000 AJT to submit a proposal
- **Quorum**: 5% of total supply must participate
- **Execution Delay**: 48-hour timelock after approval

## 💰 DeFi Integration

### Planned DeFi Features

1. **DEX Listings**
   - Uniswap V3 (Ethereum)
   - PancakeSwap (BSC)
   - QuickSwap (Polygon)

2. **Liquidity Mining**
   - AJT/ETH pools
   - AJT/USDC pools
   - Rewards for liquidity providers

3. **Staking Platform**
   - Single-asset staking (AJT)
   - LP token staking
   - Flexible and locked staking options
   - APY: 5-20% depending on lock period

4. **Lending & Borrowing**
   - Use AJT as collateral
   - Borrow stablecoins against AJT
   - Integration with Aave, Compound

## 🎨 NFT Integration

### Node NFTs

Each **AjatusNode** will be represented as an NFT:

- **Unique ID** - Each node has a unique identifier
- **Performance Stats** - Historical performance data
- **Rewards History** - Total AJT earned
- **Tradeable** - Buy/sell node licenses on OpenSea
- **Upgradeable** - Stake more AJT to increase node tier

### Achievement NFTs

Contributors can earn **Achievement NFTs** for:

- First 100 nodes
- Top 10 contributors
- Code contributions
- Community milestones
- Bug bounties
